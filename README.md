### Abstract

All happy couples resemble one another; every unhappy couple is unhappy in its own way (a). To shed light on some of those ways, we investigated how possessing a marginalized identity contributes to relationship satisfaction through the lens of the Minority Stress Model. Using a nationally representative dataset about romantic relationships, we found that respondents in sexual minority, interracial, and low-income relationships reported lower levels of satisfaction. We discovered that Black respondents in interracial relationships reported higher levels of relationship satisfaction compared to Black people in intraracial relationships. Additionally, our findings confirmed that males who earn less than their partners report lower levels of satisfaction. We demonstrate that, despite increased public approval of minority couples, they continue to face unique challenges that impact their relationship satisfaction.
